# Compilers

This repository contains files from a compilers course and project I completed in 2024. The compiler was written for a Pascal like language (picoPascal) in OCaml.

I completed a project adding compiler optimisations and a goto statement to the compiler - the report is in **CompilersReport.pdf**.

The various earlier labs involved making changes to the compiler source code to add new features and experiment.
